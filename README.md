# The pareto principal
The original observation of the Pareto Principle was linked to the relationship between wealth and population. According to what Pareto observed, 80 percent of the land in Italy was owned by 20 percent of the population. After surveying a number of other countries, he found the same applied abroad. 

For the most part, the Pareto Principle is an observation that things in life are not always distributed evenly. For instance, the efforts of 20 percent of a corporation's staff could drive 80 percent of the firm's profits. In terms of personal time management, 80 percent of your work-related output could come from only 20 percent of your time at work. In Pareto's case, he used the rule to explain how 80 percent of the wealth is controlled by 20 percent of the country's population.
